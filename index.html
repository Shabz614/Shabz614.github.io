                              PIRI is excited to announce its participation in one of the Symposia at the upcoming 8th World Conference on Research Integrity (WCRI), take place from 2-5 June 2024 in Athens, Greece. The Symposium will bring together experts and stakeholders from different areas of research integrity to discuss the "Seven challenges for research integrity education: current status and recommendations". The Symposium will strive to enhance opportunities for effective training and trainer quality in the future. The Symposium will feature three up-to-date talks. Firstly, the talk on "(Non-)Effective FAIR Training" (by Julia Prie√ü-Buchheit) that documents step-by-step a study evaluating FAIR training pointing out the status quo of learning objectives in FAIR training and possible ways to measure them. The "Improving Trainer Quality" (by Simson Mwale) will unveil the Train-The-Trainer Path2Integrity programme being used worldwide as a possible solution to enhancing trainer quality. This presentation will showcase lessons learned and ongoing efforts to support trainers in integrity and responsible conduct to improve research quality through individual capacity building (in Africa and beyond). Finally, the "Measuring Effectiveness of (culture of responsible research) RCR education" (by Mariette van den Hoven et al.) will provide insights into an international meta-analysis on how to evaluate the impact of RCR education. It will highlight the importance of observing the effectiveness of training programmes to ensure that they foster research integrity and quality.

The workshop that took place from 25-28 May 2021 was attended by 43 undergraduate and PhD students from Ghana (University of Ghana), Kenya and Zambia. At the end of the training participants were awarded EU branded certificates from Path2Integrity. This course sought to foster a culture of integrity in educational institutions and was facilitated by Path2Integrity project partner EUREC Office (European Network of Research Ethics Committees). These courses were highly interactive, focused on the needs of learners, and made use of various dialogical methods. More information can be accessed on the Moodle platform (https://learning-p2i.eu) and https://www.path2integrity.eu. Plans are underway for regular online workshops and courses for university students.

                              PIRI collaborated with 3CCompliance in organising a train the trainer programme for university educators in Zambia. This online event took place from 29-30 April 2022. Participants were drawn from the private and public sector, and universities. The programme aimed to promote a culture that supports a high level of research integrity at educational and research institutions. More specifically, this programme was designed to enhance educators‚Äô competencies, confidence, and abilities to teach research integrity effectively mainly using the Path2Integrity learning materials and methods adaptively and sustainably. The programme consisted of approximately 12-hours of sessions distributed over a 2-3-day period. PIRI intends to organise similar training with targeted educators including supervisors, and ethics committees.

We were part of the panel on a Pre-WCRI conference and made a presentation promoting innovative, learner-centered research integrity education from an African perspective, and Zambia in particular. Other issues discussed at this event were results from Path2Integrity's international mixed-method evaluation: successes and failures in teaching research integrity, barriers and challenges in introducing FAIR principles and Open Access to businesses: lessons learned while designing workshops for company employees, teaching and promoting research integrity - Polish experience in the process of building a culture of research integrity, and reflections on the quantitative evaluation of the research integrity training programme Path2Integrity.

                              PIRI participated in the Path2Integrity Final Conference on the Future of Research Integrity in Keil, Germany on 16 June 2022. The conference brought together more than 60 research integrity advocates and educators. Path2Integrity goal was to support responsible conduct of research and foster formal and informal learning towards reliable research results. At this event, PIRI made an initial presentation of the project idea on ‚ÄúThe Future of Research Ethics and Integrity in Africa‚Äù. This project idea is being developed into a full collaborative project by a consortium of nine higher education institutions from Ghana, Germany, Kenya, Netherlands, and Zambia, working together with one research institution and a private sector organisation specialised in digital learning platforms

                              PIRI organised an "Excellence Lab: Boosting Research and Innovation Cooperation between Africa and Bavaria on Environmental Protection and Circular Economy" on 28 July 2022. The event was co-organised with the Bavarian Research Alliance, Scientific Coordination Office Bavaria-Africa (BayFOR). The event was meant to inform researchers, small and medium companies, industry, and public entities from Bavaria and Africa about European funding opportunities for research and innovation and will offer an ideal platform to meet potential international project partners and exchange concrete project ideas with a focus on environmental and circular economy approaches. The event was organised against the backdrop that international cooperation with the Global South, especially Africa, is an important part of Horizon Europe, the EU's framework programme for research and innovation. The programme was embedded in the relevant policy framework of the European Commission, such as the joint Africa-EU strategy, with a focus on achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the EU Green Deal. More than 34 participants from 10 countries; 10 existing projects with 6 from Africa. A few participants were allowed to share their projects, project ideas and/or expertise on environmental protection and circular economy, to set up concrete projects including African and Bavarian stakeholders.

                              PIRI participated in the COP28 took place from 30 November to 12 December 2023 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. COP28 was used as an opportunity to explore how PIRI as a a network of researchers, academics, practitioners and pracademics, could use this platform to share environmentally sustainable practices being undertaken in our country, exchange ideas, and learn from global leaders in environmental policy and practice. COPs are valuable platform for knowledge dissemination and networking. There will be need for PIRI to get accreditation with the UNFCCC process, which is required to participate in COP events. The involvement of PIRI in future COPs will be part of the responsibilities of the Scientific Committee on Enviornment and Energy Transition committed to promoting integral ecology and contributing to global climate action, and Zambia in particular.
